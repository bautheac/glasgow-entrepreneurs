  <LINE>POST OFFICE REGULATIONS.</LINE>
  <LINE>POSTAGE STAMPS, &amp;c.</LINE>
  <LINE>Prepayment of Inland Letters, &amp;c, must be by</LINE>
  <LINE>Stamps.</LINE>
  <LINE>RATES OF POSTAGE.</LINE>
  <LINE>Inland Letters.*</LINE>
  <LINE>1. The rate of postage on all inland letters is re-</LINE>
  <LINE>gulated by weight, irrespective of distance, and (with</LINE>
  <LINE>the exception afterwards mentioned) is as follows: —</LINE>
  <LINE>If paid in advance.</LINE>
  <LINE>Letter weighing not more than ^ oz., Id.</LINE>
  <LINE>Letter weighing more than ^ oz., but not ex-</LINE>
  <LINE>ceeding 1 oz., 2d.</LINE>
  <LINE>Letter weighing more than 1 oz., but not more</LINE>
  <LINE>than 2 oz., '. 4d.</LINE>
  <LINE>Letter weighing more than 2 oz., but not 3 oz. 6d.</LINE>
  <LINE>and so on ; twopence being charged for every addi-</LINE>
  <LINE>tional ounce.</LINE>
  <LINE>2. As a general rule, the postage, if not paid in</LINE>
  <LINE>advance, is double the foregoing ; and if the pay-</LINE>
  <LINE>ment in advance be insufficient, double the deficiency</LINE>
  <LINE>is charged. An inland letter, for example, weigh-</LINE>
  <LINE>ing more than half an ounce, and not exceeding on%</LINE>
  <LINE>ounce, if bearing a penny stamp only, is, on delivery,</LINE>
  <LINE>charged twopence. The unpaid additional postage</LINE>
  <LINE>on re-directed letters, however, is not doubled, being</LINE>
  <LINE>the same as if such postage were prepaid. Unless</LINE>
  <LINE>three quarters, at least, of the postage of a letter</LINE>
  <LINE>weighing more than 4 oz. be prepaid, the letter is</LINE>
  <LINE>not forwarded, but notice of its detention is given to</LINE>
  <LINE>the sender, or when thft is not practicable, to the</LINE>
  <LINE>person to whom the letter is addressed.</LINE>
  <LINE>Colonial and Foreign Letters.</LINE>
  <LINE>3. The rates of postage on letters to foreign coun-</LINE>
  <LINE>tries and the colonies are entered in the Table of</LINE>
  <LINE>Colonial and Foreign Postage at pages 5-17.</LINE>
  <LINE>Addresses to the Queen and Petitions to Parliament.</LINE>
  <LINE>4. Petitions and addresses to her Majesty, for-</LINE>
  <LINE>warded direct, are exempt from postage; and such</LINE>
  <LINE>petitions and addresses, as also petitions to either</LINE>
  <LINE>House of Parliament, if sent to a member of either</LINE>
  <LINE>House are likewise exempt, provided they do not</LINE>
  <LINE>weigh more than two pounds, and are without</LINE>
  <LINE>covers, or in covers open at the sides. No letter or</LINE>
  <LINE>other inclosure, however, must be inserted, and if</LINE>
  <LINE>one be found, such inclosure, unless it bear the pro-</LINE>
  <LINE>per number of postage stamps, will be charged as an</LINE>
  <LINE>unpaid letter.</LINE>
  <LINE>Newspaper and other periodical Publications bearing</LINE>
  <LINE>the Newspaper Stamp.</LINE>
  <LINE>5. Although provision is made for forwarding</LINE>
  <LINE>newspapers, books, and money through the post, it</LINE>
  <LINE>is not compulsory on any one to employ this mode</LINE>
  <LINE>of transmission ; everything except letters may be</LINE>
  <LINE>6ent in any other way.</LINE>
  <LINE>6. All periodical publications, including news-</LINE>
  <LINE>papers published in the United Kingdom, at inter-</LINE>
  <LINE>vals not exceeding thirty-one days, and which bear</LINE>
  <LINE>* Inland letters are those which pass between places</LINE>
  <LINE>in the United Kingdom, including the Isle of Man, the</LINE>
  <LINE>Orkney, Shetland, Scilly, and Channel Islands. If the</LINE>
  <LINE>weight be exceeded to the smallest extent, even though</LINE>
  <LINE>the balance be merely turned, the letter becomes liable to</LINE>
  <LINE>a higher postage. The same rule applies to letters gomg</LINE>
  <LINE>abroad. To provide, therefore, for errors in scales, &amp;c, it</LINE>
  <LINE>is well to allow a little margin, or to pay the postage of</LINE>
  <LINE>the next greater weight.</LINE>
  <LINE>an impressed stamp or stamps denoting the stamp</LINE>
  <LINE>duty (of the kind formerly confined chiefly to news-</LINE>
  <LINE>papers), may be transmitted and re-transmitted</LINE>
  <LINE>through the post within the United Kingdom free of</LINE>
  <LINE>postage under the following regulations, viz. : —</LINE>
  <LINE>1st. They are subject to the same restrictions with</LINE>
  <LINE>regard to the number of sheets and superficial ex-</LINE>
  <LINE>tent as were formerly applicable only to newspapers</LINE>
  <LINE>properly so called. These restrictions are shown in</LINE>
  <LINE>the following table : —</LINE>
  <LINE>Amount of Stamps</LINE>
  <LINE>Impressed on</LINE>
  <LINE>the Publication.</LINE>
  <LINE>Maximum</LINE>
  <LINE>Number of Sheets.</LINE>
  <LINE>Maximum Super-</LINE>
  <LINE>ficial extent of</LINE>
  <LINE>Letterpress on</LINE>
  <LINE>one side.</LINE>
  <LINE>One Penny - - -</LINE>
  <LINE>Three Halfpence</LINE>
  <LINE>Twopence - - -</LINE>
  <LINE>Two - - - -</LINE>

  <LINE>2,295 inches.</LINE>
  <LINE>3,443 «</LINE>

  <LINE>2d. No publication, or portion thereof, can pass,</LINE>
  <LINE>through the post unless the impressed stamp which</LINE>
  <LINE>it bears be a stamp of the value at least of one</LINE>
  <LINE>penny.</LINE>
  <LINE>3d. The title and date of the publication must be</LINE>
  <LINE>printed at the top of every page.</LINE>
  <LINE>4th. The publication must be folded in such a.</LINE>
  <LINE>manner that the whole of the stamp or stamps, de-</LINE>
  <LINE>noting the full duty, shall be exposed to view, and</LINE>
  <LINE>be distinctly visible on the outside, except that</LINE>
  <LINE>where there are more than two publications in the</LINE>
  <LINE>same cover it will be considered sufficient if the</LINE>
  <LINE>stamps be so arranged that they can readily be ex-</LINE>
  <LINE>amined.</LINE>
  <LINE>5th. It must not be printed on pasteboard or card-</LINE>
  <LINE>board, or on two or more thicknesses of paper pasted</LINE>
  <LINE>together, nor must any pasteboard, cardboard, or</LINE>
  <LINE>such pasted paper be sent with it as a back or cover</LINE>
  <LINE>thereto, or otherwise.</LINE>
  <LINE>6th. It must be posted within fifteen days from</LINE>
  <LINE>the printed date of issue.</LINE>

  <LINE>such name and address, the printed title of the</LINE>
  <LINE>publication, and the printed name and address of the</LINE>
  <LINE>publisher or vender who sends it. Thus, if a news-</LINE>
  <LINE>paper, franked by a newspaper stamp, after having</LINE>
  <LINE>had the address of one person written upon the</LINE>
  <LINE>paper itself, be sent to another person, the first ad-</LINE>
  <LINE>dress must be cut off (obliteration not being suffi-</LINE>
  <LINE>cient), otherwise the paper will be charged as an</LINE>
  <LINE>unpaid letter.</LINE>
  <LINE>10th. If the publication be addressed to any per-</LINE>
  <LINE>son within the free delivery of the place where it is</LINE>
  <LINE>posted, it will become liable to a postage of one</LINE>
  <LINE>penny, which must be prepaid by affixing a postage</LINE>
  <LINE>stamp.</LINE>
  <LINE>11th. When a newspaper, &amp;c, is so folded as not</LINE>
  <LINE>to expose the stamp or stamps, a postage of one</LINE>
  <LINE>penny is charged in addition to any other postage</LINE>
  <LINE>to which the publication, if properly folded, would</LINE>
  <LINE>be liable ; and if the newspaper, &amp;c, be addressed to</LINE>
  <LINE>any person within the free delivery of the place where</LINE>
  <LINE>it is posted, and do not bear a penny postage label,</LINE>
  <LINE>it will be charged 2d.</LINE>
  <LINE>12th. In case of an}' other irregularity the pub-</LINE>
  <LINE>lication is dealt with as an unpaid letter.</LINE>
