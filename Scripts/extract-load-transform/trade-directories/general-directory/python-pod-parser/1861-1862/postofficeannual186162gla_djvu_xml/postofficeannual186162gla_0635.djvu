  <LINE>14th. Stamped publications can also be forwarded</LINE>

  <LINE>Kingdom, except as regards size, and that, before</LINE>
  <LINE>going abroad, the name of the newspaper must have</LINE>
  <LINE>been registered at the General Post Office, and that,</LINE>
  <LINE>instead of requiring to have an impressed stamp (by</LINE>
  <LINE>which is meant the stamp specially used for news-</LINE>
  <LINE>papers), each newspaper, if sent to a foreign country,</LINE>
  <LINE>is liable to the postage entered in the Table of</LINE>
  <LINE>Colonial and Foreign Postage, and if sent to a</LINE>
  <LINE>British colony, to a postage of a Id., with an addition</LINE>
  <LINE>(as shown in the Table of Colonial and Foreign</LINE>
  <LINE>Postage), when the newspaper has to pass through</LINE>
  <LINE>a foreign country ; this additional postage being also</LINE>
  <LINE>payable in stamps only* In all cases of news-</LINE>
  <LINE>papers going abroad the impressed stamp stands for</LINE>
  <LINE>nothing. Publications registered for transmission</LINE>
  <LINE>abroad, although not strictly newspapers, are in all</LINE>
  <LINE>respects treated as such, as far as transmission by</LINE>

  <LINE>where the above-mentioned printed papers are</LINE>
