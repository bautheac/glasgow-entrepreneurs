  <LINE>12. The Head Postmaster who first receives a</LINE>
  <LINE>book-packet is required, whenever he has ground for</LINE>
  <LINE>suspecting an infringement of any of the above</LINE>
  <LINE>conditions, and occasionally, even when there is no</LINE>
  <LINE>ground for suspicion, to open and examine the</LINE>
  <LINE>packet; and every book-packet which is not open</LINE>
  <LINE>at the ends or sides, or which exceeds two feet in</LINE>
  <LINE>length, width, or dep;h, or which has any written</LINE>
  <LINE>letter, or any communication of the nature of a letter,</LINE>
  <LINE>written in it or upon its cover, or which does not beat-</LINE>
  <LINE>postage stamps equal to a single book- rate, is ordered</LINE>
  <LINE>to be sent up. wi h as littl.- del y as possible, to the</LINE>
  <LINE>Returned Letter Branch of the Circulation Office in</LINE>
  <LINE>Edinburgh; but in the case of any other infringement</LINE>
  <LINE>of the regulations, the packet is dealt with by the</LINE>
  <LINE>Postmaster himself, in accordance with ihe above</LINE>
  <LINE>regulations. If the book-packet be for a British</LINE>
  <LINE>colony or a foreign country to which the book post</LINE>
  <LINE>extends, and is sufficiently prepaid, it is, whether</LINE>
  <LINE>posted in K.ngland, Ireland, or Scotland, sent to the</LINE>
  <LINE>Returned Letter Branch, London, where it is detained</LINE>
  <LINE>until the proper postage, together with one additional</LINE>
  <LINE>book-rate, is obtained.</LINE>
  <LINE>13. To prevent obstacles to the regular trans-</LINE>
  <LINE>mission of letters, any Head Postmaster may, when</LINE>
  <LINE>necessary, delay forwarding a bo..k-packet, not a</LINE>
  <LINE>newspaper, for a period not exceeding twenty-four</LINE>
  <LINE>hours beyond the ordinary time; and at Packet</LINE>
  <LINE>( iffices* the delay may, at the option of the Post-</LINE>
  <LINE>master, be either for that period, or until the despatch</LINE>
  <LINE>of the mail next after that by which the book-packet</LINE>
  <LINE>ought otherwise to be forwarded.</LINE>
  <LINE>14. It must be borne in mind that the main busi-</LINE>
  <LINE>ness of the Post Office is the transmission of letters,</LINE>
  <LINE>and that the forwarding of bo..ks and newspapers</LINE>
  <LINE>(which no one is compelled to send through the</LINE>
  <LINE>Post Office), though an important, is only a second-</LINE>
  <LINE>ary object, for which no arrangement cm be made</LINE>
  <LINE>which would interfere with the quick and regular</LINE>
  <LINE>conveyance and delivery of letters. Books, there-</LINE>
  <LINE>fore, which would be injured by being thrust into a</LINE>
  <LINE>basr, and hurriedly pre-sed down like a bundle of</LINE>
  <LINE>letters, should not be sent through the post.</LINE>

  <LINE>quired to have on hand a sufficient stock of pi stage</LINE>

  <LINE>It!. Every Rural Messenger is authorized to sell</LINE>
  <LINE>postage labels and embossed envelopes at the same</LINE>
  <LINE>prices at which Postmasters are empowered to sell</LINE>
  <LINE>them, and when any person applies to him for such</LINE>
  <LINE>labels the Messenger must either supply them, or (if</LINE>
