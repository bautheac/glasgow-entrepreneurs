  <LINE>pared) is attended with much inconvenience, and</LINE>

  <LINE>SUGGESTIONS TO THE PUBLIC, &amp;c.</LINE>
  <LINE>91. Facility is given to the Post Office in the dis-</LINE>
  <LINE>charge of its daily duties, and greater security</LINE>
  <LINE>afforded to the public, by careful attention to the</LINE>
  <LINE>following recommendations : —</LINE>
  <LINE>1st. To post all letters, &amp;c. as early as practicable,</LINE>
  <LINE>especially when sent in large numbers, as is frequently</LINE>
  <LINE>the case with newspapers and circulars.</LINE>
  <LINE>2nd. When several letters are sent by the same</LINE>
  <LINE>person for registration, they be accompanied with a</LINE>
  <LINE>list in duplicate of the addresses; one list to be</LINE>
  <LINE>retained at the Post Office, and the other, when</LINE>
  <LINE>signed, to be returned by the bearer. This practice</LINE>
  <LINE>(which is adopted by many bankers) saves time</LINE>
  <LINE>both to the public and to the department.</LINE>
  <LINE>3rd. To make the address legible * and complete,</LINE>
  <LINE>giving the name of the post town, and if there be</LINE>
  <LINE>more than one town in the kingdom, of that name</LINE>
  <LINE>(but not otherwise) adding that of the county.</LINE>
  <LINE>Letters posted in one part of the United Kingdom,</LINE>
  <LINE>and intended for another part (as, for example,</LINE>
  <LINE>letters posted in Scotland and intended for England</LINE>
  <LINE>or Ireland) should have the name of the country to</LINE>
  <LINE>which they are sent added to the other part of the</LINE>
  <LINE>address. The number of the house too, if in a</LINE>
  <LINE>street, is a great assistance. It must not be sup-</LINE>
  <LINE>posed that because a letter will eventually reach its</LINE>
  <LINE>destination without a number, the omission is not a</LINE>
  <LINE>cause of hesitation and delay in the process of sorting</LINE>
  <LINE>for deliver}'; and when such small delays occur</LINE>
  <LINE>* As an instance of miscarriage owing to the want of</LINE>
  <LINE>legibility, it may be mentioned that badly directed letters</LINE>
  <LINE>intended for Belgravia, have not unfrequently been sent</LINE>
  <LINE>to Belgrade.</LINE>
