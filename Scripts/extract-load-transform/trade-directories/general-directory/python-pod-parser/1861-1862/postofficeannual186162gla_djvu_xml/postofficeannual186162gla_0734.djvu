  <LINE>THE Rates of Premium are on the lowest Scale consistent with stability, and so varied as to accommodate</LINE>
  <LINE>the views of every class of insurers.</LINE>
  <LINE>This Institution is empowered under special Act of Parliament, and so constituted as to afford the benefits</LINE>
  <LINE>of Life Assurance in their fullest extent to Policy Holders, and to present greater facilities and accommodation</LINE>
  <LINE>than can be obtained in any similar Establishment. Increasing and decreasing Rates of Premium on a new</LINE>
  <LINE>and remarkable plan have been constructed, peculiarly advantageous for securing loans or debts. By the</LINE>
  <LINE>former mode, a less immediate payment is required on a Policy than in any other office, and the amount of</LINE>
  <LINE>future payment optional with the Assurer.</LINE>
  <LINE>The following important improvements on the ordinary system of Life Assurance have been adopted by the</LINE>
  <LINE>Britannia Company, and are recommended to the particular attention of ike public : —</LINE>
  <LINE>Age of the Assured in every case admitted in the Policy.</LINE>
  <LINE>All claims payable in Three Months after proof of death, while other Offices take Six Months to consider</LINE>
  <LINE>this momentous question.</LINE>
  <LINE>Medical Attendants remunerated by the Company in all cases for their reports, by which an important saving</LINE>
  <LINE>is effected to parties insuring.</LINE>
  <LINE>No charge made for Policies or Admission Fees.</LINE>
  <LINE>Policies revived within Twelve Months after expiration, on evidence of unimpaired health, without payment</LINE>
  <LINE>of the fine demanded by other Offices.</LINE>
  <LINE>Premiums may be paid Half- Yearly or Quarterly, and payments may be made to terminate after five, ten,</LINE>
  <LINE>or any other number of years required.</LINE>
  <LINE>A Board of Directors in attendance Daily at two o'clock.</LINE>
  <LINE>Thirty days allowed for Renewal of Policies. And in case any person Assured shall die within the said</LINE>
  <LINE>space of Thirty Days, and the party holding Policy from the Company, or his representatives, or any other</LINE>
  <LINE>person on his or their behoof, the Policy ivill be as valid and effectual as if the Premium had been paid when</LINE>
  <LINE>due, and in the lifetime of the person Assured.</LINE>
  <LINE>The business of the Company in Scotland is so constituted as to confer all the benefits of purely Scotch</LINE>
  <LINE>Offices, and may sue or be sued in the Scotch courts, and does not require Probates, or Letters of Adminis-</LINE>
  <LINE>tration, on the lapsing of Policies.</LINE>
  <LINE>Parties Insuring with this Company can deduct the Annual Premiums on their own and their wives' lives</LINE>
  <LINE>from the amount assessed upon for Income Tax.</LINE>
