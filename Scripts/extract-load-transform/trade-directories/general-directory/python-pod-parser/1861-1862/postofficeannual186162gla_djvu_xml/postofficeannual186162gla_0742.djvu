  <LINE>COLONIAL AND FOREIGN ASSURANCES.</LINE>
  <LINE>THE COLONIAL LIFE ASSURANCE COMPANY was established at Edinburgh in 1846, and</LINE>
  <LINE>introduced new and important features into Life Assurance practice, by publishing rates calculated for</LINE>
  <LINE>Foreign residence, and by establisbing Agencies abroad, thus affording increased facilities to persons whose</LINE>
  <LINE>views or occupations might lead them to travel or reside in other countries. By its means, also, the benefits</LINE>
  <LINE>of Life Assurance were extended to India and to the Colonies of Great Britain generally, on such beneficial</LINE>
  <LINE>terms, and under such liberal conditions, as improved knowledge and the circumstances of the times autho-</LINE>
  <LINE>rized and required.</LINE>
  <LINE>The progress of the business has been most successful and satisfactory in every respect, and its extent has</LINE>
  <LINE>proved how greatly such an institution was wanted.</LINE>
  <LINE>THE RATES OF THE COMPANY for Colonial and Foreign residence will be found moderate, and</LINE>
  <LINE>looking to the facilities and advantages afforded by the Company, tbey may be considered more advantageous,</LINE>
  <LINE>and virtually less expensive, than those of any other Office doing business abroad.</LINE>
  <LINE>For the purpose of giving increased facilities, also, in the Company's transactions, the Directors have</LINE>
  <LINE>formed Local Boards of Management, and Branch Offices, in India and the Colonies, where Assurances may</LINE>
  <LINE>be effected, Premiums paid, and claims settled.</LINE>
  <LINE>HOME ASSURANCE.</LINE>
  <LINE>The Directors of the Colonial Life Assurance Company having directed much attention to the</LINE>
  <LINE>Classification of Risks in connection with Lives Abroad, in which they have been most successful,</LINE>
  <LINE>have turned their attention to the Classification of Home Risks, so as to give Professional Men, and</LINE>
  <LINE>settled persons of all classes whose occupations are not likely to call them beyond the limits of Europe, the</LINE>
  <LINE>advantage and privilege of possessing Policies, unfettered by restrictions as to foreign residence, on terms</LINE>
  <LINE>which the absence of such extra risks authorizes them to adopt.</LINE>
  <LINE>The Directors have, in accordance with these views, resolved to grant to Persons resident in this country,</LINE>
  <LINE>whose occupation, profession, or calling, infers a residence in the United Kingdom, and who declare that they</LINE>
  <LINE>have no intention or prospect of going abroad,</LINE>
  <LINE>Policies without any Restriction as to Residence.</LINE>
  <LINE>It is not possible to state exactly the Professions which this Class will embrace, and much will depend on</LINE>
  <LINE>the features and particulars of each case ; but the Directors may mention a few Professions and Occupations</LINE>
  <LINE>which the new Class will include:— Country Gentlemen, Barristers and Advocates, Solicitors,</LINE>
