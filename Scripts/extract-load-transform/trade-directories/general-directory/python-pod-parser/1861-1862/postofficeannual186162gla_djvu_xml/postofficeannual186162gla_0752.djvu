  <LINE>LIFE DEPARTMENT.</LINE>
  <LINE>I^HE NORTH BRITISH INSURANCE COMPANY, as a Life Office, was established in 1823.</LINE>
  <LINE>The principles on which it was founded, and on which it continues to act, combine the system of</LINE>
  <LINE>Mutual Insurance with the safety of a large Protecting Capital, and thus afford all the facilities</LINE>
  <LINE>and advantages which can prudently be offered by any Life Assurance Office.</LINE>
  <LINE>In virtue of the Guarantee afforded by its Capital, the Company can adopt rates lower than what are</LINE>
  <LINE>practicable by a purely Mutual office ; while, in virtue of the principle of giving the insured, in their option, a</LINE>
  <LINE>right to a share in the Profits, they derive the same, or even a greater benefit, than if they actually belonged</LINE>
  <LINE>to a Mutual office.</LINE>
  <LINE>The Premiums are regulated on these two principles — either a party may pay a higher rate, and secure the</LINE>
  <LINE>benefit of a share in the Profits, or he may adopt a lower rate, while he has absolute security for the payment</LINE>
  <LINE>of the amount in his Policy.</LINE>
  <LINE>ADVANTAGES OFFERED BY THIS COMPANY.</LINE>
  <LINE>1. Nine-tenths (90 per cent.) of the Profits, or, in other words, the whole of the Profits arising from the Life</LINE>
  <LINE>Business, after setting aside one-tenth for the guarantee, are divided among the Assured entitled to</LINE>
  <LINE>participate.</LINE>
  <LINE>■2. Bonuses may be added to the sum assured, or surrendered for a cash payment, or applied to the reduction</LINE>
  <LINE>of the future Premiums.</LINE>
  <LINE>3. A prospective Bonus of one per cent, per annum is allowed on Policies which have subsisted for five</LINE>
  <LINE>years, which may become claims previous to the next Investigation in 1865.</LINE>
  <LINE>4. The sum insured may be made payable at any given age, or at death, if it occur previously.</LINE>
  <LINE>■5. An ascending scale of Premiums, whereby Policies may be effected at the lowest possible rates.</LINE>
  <LINE>C&gt;. On Insurances for a Whole Period of Life, half the Premium may remain on credit for the first Five</LINE>
  <LINE>Years, or one-third during the convenience of the party assured.</LINE>
  <LINE>7. No Extra Charge for residence in British North America, the Cape, Australia (excluding the Diggings),</LINE>
  <LINE>Nevv Zealand, Port Natal, and parts of the United States ; and no license required except for the</LINE>
  <LINE>voyage.</LINE>
  <LINE>8. On proof of age, and by special application, Policies are declared unchallengeable from and after the expiry</LINE>
  <LINE>of Five Years from their date: and parties, on receiving a license, may go to any part of the world</LINE>
  <LINE>without incurring the forfeiture of their Policies — thus making the Policies of the Company good</LINE>
  <LINE>marketable securities.</LINE>
  <LINE>9. Advances made on Policies, to the extent of the security they afford, when the value amounts to £50</LINE>
  <LINE>and upwards.</LINE>
  <LINE>10. No Entry-Money or Other Charge : and Policy Stamp paid by the Office.</LINE>
