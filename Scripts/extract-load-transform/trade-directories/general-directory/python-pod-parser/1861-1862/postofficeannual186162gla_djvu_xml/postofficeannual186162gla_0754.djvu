  <LINE>THE Company, established in 1823, has existed upwards of thirty-seven years, and has been incorpo-</LINE>
  <LINE>rated by Act of Parliament, for the purpose of carrying on the business of Life Assurance in all its</LINE>
  <LINE>branches, on the most liberal and approved principles. The success which has attended the Company since</LINE>
  <LINE>its commencement, and its annually increasing prosperity, is a gratifying proof that the principles upon •'■ G</LINE>
  <LINE>tvhich it is founded are calculated to confer great benefits on Assurers. W. '</LINE>
  <LINE>The following are the principal advantages given by this Company: — AM</LINE>
  <LINE>Mutual Assurance, without liability. See English Law Cases for Call on the Policy-holders in a Mutual</LINE>
  <LINE>Insurance Society for Debts of the Society.</LINE>
  <LINE>The guarantee of a responsible body of Proprietors, either personally or otherwise, assured with the</LINE>
  <LINE>Office, affords the most undoubted security to all classes of Assurers, in addition to the accumu-</LINE>
  <LINE>lated and invested fund of the Company, now upwards of Three-fourths of a Million.</LINE>
  <LINE>Nine-Tenths of the whole Profits Septennially divisible among the Assured— ^a larger proportion than</LINE>
  <LINE>can be divided with safety by any simple Mutual Assurance Society.</LINE>
  <LINE>An Intermediate Bonus paid on Policies becoming Claims between one Investigation and another.</LINE>
  <LINE>All the advantages of an Annual division are thus given, without its attendant evils.</LINE>
  <LINE>The Most Equitable Principle op Division.</LINE>
  <LINE>The greatest benefits are thereby bestowed upon all Jirst-class lives, by no undue Bonus being paid</LINE>
  <LINE>away to those who may die early.</LINE>
  <LINE>Bates of Premium extremely Moderate. — The non-participation scale very favourable for security</LINE>
  <LINE>on Loans, or for partnership Insurances.</LINE>
  <LINE>In reference to the next Septennial Division of this Office in 1863, the special attention of intending-</LINE>
  <LINE>Insurers is requested to the Benefits which the Company's system of Division has conferred on its Par-</LINE>
  <LINE>ticipating Assured; illustrated in the results of previous Declarations to the old Policy-holders — the best</LINE>
  <LINE>class Lives.</LINE>
  <LINE>The following are a few of these claims now or previously paid, with</LINE>
  <LINE>BONUSES EXCEEDING ONE HUNDEED PER CENT. ON THE SUMS ORIGINALLY</LINE>

  <LINE>Later Entrants have received Bonuses proportionate to their endurance and payments, as illustrated in</LINE>
  <LINE>Prospectus.</LINE>
  <LINE>Bonuses may be surrendered for cash, or applied in reduction of the annual premiums. By this latter</LINE>
  <LINE>course, several of the oldest Policy-holders have redeemed their premiums, with a bonus still attaching to</LINE>
  <LINE>the Policy, and increasing.</LINE>
