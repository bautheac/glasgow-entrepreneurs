  <LINE>LIFE ASSOCIATION OF SCOTLAND,</LINE>
  <LINE>FOUNDED 1838.</LINE>
  <LINE>EMPOWERED BY ROYAL CHARTER AND ACT OF PARLIAMENT.</LINE>
  <LINE>HTH</LINE>
  <LINE>E ASSOCIATION has now in operation two separate Schemes of Assurance.</LINE>
  <LINE>THE ORIGINAL SCHEME- (CLASS A)</LINE>
  <LINE>is expressly based on the principle of reducing the expense of Life Assurance as low as is consistent with</LINE>
  <LINE>permanent security, and offers the following, among other advantages : —</LINE>
  <LINE>FREEDOM FROM RESTRICTIONS.— The Policies now being issued are unusually free from Restric-</LINE>
  <LINE>tions (as commonly imposed by other companies) and confer important privileges. These relate to</LINE>
  <LINE>Non-payment of Premiums — Indisputability — Limits of residence and occupation — Military and Naval</LINE>
  <LINE>Services, &amp;c. ; and afford, in most cases, almost complete protection against forfeiture.</LINE>
  <LINE>PROFIT SCHEME. — An Allocation of Profit is made evert/ year to Participating Policy- Holders of five</LINE>
  <LINE>years' standing at the date of the preceding balance, and the Share of Profit is applied in reducing</LINE>
  <LINE>their next Premiums. Each Policy-Holder thus enjoys DURING HIS OWN LIFE his share of</LINE>
  <LINE>the Profit. The annual return of Profit to Policy-Holders of the first series has now attained to</LINE>
  <LINE>THIRTY-SEVEN AND A HALF PER CENT, of the Premiums ; that is, a Policy-Holder whose</LINE>
  <LINE>Premium is £50 obtains this year a returu of £18 15s., and another whose Premium is £20 obtains</LINE>
  <LINE>£7 10s.</LINE>
  <LINE>HALF-CREDIT SYSTEM.— Policies of £500 and upwards may be effected and kept up by payment of</LINE>
  <LINE>only One-half the Premiums for the first six years, with interest on the other half. The first pay-</LINE>
  <LINE>ments for Policies of £500 are thus onlv— Age 25, £5 15s. Id.; Age 30, £6 lis. 3d. ; Age 40,</LINE>
  <LINE>£8 lis. Id. And for Policies of £1000, Age 25, £11 10s. 2d.; Age 30, £13 2s. 6d. ; Age 40,</LINE>
  <LINE>£17 2s. 2d.</LINE>
  <LINE>NEW SCHEME— (CLASS B).</LINE>
  <LINE>UNCONDITIONAL ASSURANCE ON LIFE.</LINE>
  <LINE>While the Policies of the Original Scheme have for many years been relieved of most of the imper-</LINE>
  <LINE>fections which still adhere to Assurance Policies in general, the Association have now met the desire of late</LINE>
  <LINE>manifested in some quarters for a system of Life Assurance still more simple and unconditional, and have</LINE>
  <LINE>introduced a Scheme with this special view. The leading features of the Scheme are these: —</LINE>
  <LINE>OMISSION to pay a premium by oversight does not affect the Assurance, and after a time, Payment may</LINE>
  <LINE>be intentionally Postponed for a year.</LINE>
  <LINE>NO RESTRICTION is imposed as to Occupation or Residence.</LINE>
  <LINE>NO EXTRA PREMIUMS can ever be payable.</LINE>
  <LINE>The ASSURANCE is virtually Non-forfeitable and Unquestionable</LINE>
  <LINE>The POLICY-HOLDER, on surrendering his Policy, can withdraw a fixed and unusually large proportion</LINE>
  <LINE>of his Payments, or he may, in most cases, take a paid-up Policy for double the amount ; or he may</LINE>
  <LINE>withdraw the same sum as a Loan, and still continue the Policy.</LINE>
  <LINE>So Complete and Satisfactory a system of Unconditional Assurance is not to be found in the</LINE>
  <LINE>arrangements of any other Assurance Office.</LINE>
