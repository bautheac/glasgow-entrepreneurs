  <LINE>l®° Letter [A] Machine. — This Sewing Machine is very differently arranged from any other, and is orna-</LINE>
  <LINE>mented in the best atyle of art." It is designed to be enclosed, when desired, in a highly finished and richly decorated</LINE>
  <LINE>cabinet case. It is very popular as a Family Sewing Machine, especially in large household establishments where</LINE>
  <LINE>a considerable proportion of heavy work is to be doue, as well as light sewing. For Shirt and Collar Manufacturers,</LINE>
  <LINE>Cloak, Mantle, and dressmakers, and light Manufacturing in general, these Machines justly deserve the commenda-</LINE>
  <LINE>tion which they are receiving on every hand. ■</LINE>
  <LINE>Owing to the demand for our celebrated Sewing Machines being far greater than the supply, we have recently</LINE>
  <LINE>increased our manufactory in New York four-fold. The facilities which we now have for manufacturing will enable</LINE>
  <LINE>us to turn out 130,000 Machines annually. With this great extension we hope to be able to supply the rapidly</LINE>
  <LINE>increasing demand. For domestic use, and all manufacturing purposes of every description, " Light or Heavy," these</LINE>
  <LINE>Machines are unquestionably the most perfect, most substantial, most durable, and most reliable SEWING</LINE>
  <LINE>MACHINES ever offered to the public. The superior merits of these Machines are well known to all the principal</LINE>
  <LINE>manufacturers in the United Kingdom. We have recently made valuable and important improvements, which still</LINE>
  <LINE>further advances the utility of our Machines far beyond those of any other manufacture. The stitching produced by</LINE>
  <LINE>these Machines cannot be ravelled or pulled out, both sides of the work being alike, which is not the case with many</LINE>
  <LINE>other Machines. Every Machine is thoroughly tested before leaving our Manufactory, and warranted perfect.— Send for</LINE>
